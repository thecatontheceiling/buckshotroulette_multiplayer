How to always know the bullet order in the gun in multiplayer:

1. Go to where Buckshot Roulette is installed
2. Click into the File Explorer address bar and type "cmd", press enter.
3. Type in "Buckshot Roulette.exe" into the console and press enter.
4. Join a multiplayer game. When you reach the animation where it shows you the count of the lives and blanks, go back to the command prompt window and look for a text saying "sequence_in_shotgun". Should look something like this (i.e. "sequence_in_shotgun": ["blank", "blank", "live", "live", "blank", "live"]):
